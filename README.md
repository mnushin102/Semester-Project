# In this project, we're going to select a topic that relates to distributed network computing 

# Our selected topic is computer networking

# Our project should encompass software developmentm meticulous experimentation, and through analysis of outcomes. 

# If this is possible, we need to steer clear of naturally-distribution challenges; we must aim for something that presents a substantial complexity. 

# This is our approach: 
- For Computer Networking, we decided to research this topic because we were both interested how we're going to connect all nodes between Computer A and Computer B.
- Establishing these connections is going to allow users to communicate easily through the nodes.
- After these communications are established, they will determine if the nodes are successfully linked to our router, server, firewall and internet.

# This is our purpose: 
- The goal of this topic is to share resources through a reliable communication formed between multiple networks within a linked connection amongst each other.
- Another purpose of this project is to share different types
