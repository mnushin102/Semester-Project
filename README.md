# In this project, we're going to select a topic that relates to distributed network computing 

# Our selected topic is computer networking

# Our project should encompass software developmentm meticulous experimentation, and through analysis of outcomes. 

# If this is possible, we need to steer clear of naturally-distribution challenges; we must aim for something that presents a substantial complexity. 

# This is our approach: 
- For Computer Networking, we decided to research this topic because we were both interested how we're going to connect all nodes between Computer A and Computer B.
- Establishing these connections is going to allow users to communicate easily through the nodes.
- After these communications are established, they will determine if the nodes are successfully linked to our router, server, firewall and internet.

# This is our purpose: 
- The goal of this topic is to share resources through a reliable communication formed between multiple networks within a linked connection amongst each other.
- Another purpose of this project is to share different types of networks such as Local Area Network, Wide Area Network, Metropolitan Area Network, and Wireless Network. These networks enchance the communication with two or more nodes in which these will all be linked using wires to share data.
- We are trying to also understand the 7 layers of the OSI model have a very important purpose with computer networking and that it uses layers for visual representation of how a networking system functions. These layers have a protocol which can be interchanged very comfortably since model modifications don't influence other layers that change significantly.
